# PyDelta-DeObfuscator
A python deobfuscator for WolfHex's PyDelta-PythonObfuscator.

# Info
If you have a python file obfuscated using PyDelta, You can drag and drop it into the terminal and then hit enter, It'll automatically unravel, decrypt/decode, and clean up the code as best as it can. However due to variables and function names being renamed I can only go as far as that and then rename them again to something more readable.

In doing so, if you have `"""` in the main code, it'll be replaced with `'double_quote'`. so just keep that in mind for code blocks, etc. and any `'\'` will be escaped `'\\'`.
